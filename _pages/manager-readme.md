## Motivation for this document

1. Helping others to get to know me better without having the time to actually get to know me better
2. Being transparent about my expectations and proactively working towards better working relationships

## My role

1. Delivering Technical and Strategic outcomes by leading teams and providing technical vision and direction
2. Coaching team members in achieving their technical career goals

## What do I value most?

1. What does helping me look like?
    1. Being direct and asking clearly for what you need and how I can help
    1. Providing context on what the problem is, how you tried to approach resolving it, and exactly what you need from me
    1. Providing timely updates on what's blocking you or what you're working on before I have to ask. **Proactive communication is HUGE for me.**
2. What is my process for handling conflicts?
    1. I give myself time to process my thoughts on the matter, give as much benefit of the doubt to the other party
    1. Then I either ask the opinions of unrelated people I trust to guide me AND/OR address the person directly in a private setting to understand the other person's perspective 
3. What weaknesses of mine should the team know about, and how can they help me improve?
    1. I can get overwhelmed when I do not take enough time for myself: ask if I need a break or suggest lying down for a bit of time, that usually helps me to snap out of it
    1. I have a tendency to rush/overgeneralize problems: please be patient with me and take the time to clearly walk through the challenges that have been encountered
    1. I may get micro-managey: please provide timely updates so that I do not need/want to chase after you. We are all adults, I want to treat you accordingly unless proven otherwise.

## My Expectations

1. How should people set time with you?
    1. Book time in my calendar if it's a longer discussion
    1. Ping me in chat if you can wait 0-4 hours
    1. Call me if there's a burning fire (please walk away from the fire first)
2. When it comes to mistakes, what's the best way for employees to come forward?
    1. Tell me about the mistake AND tell me your plan on how you plan to address it (do not come to me with only problems)
4. How do you define "Done"?
    1. Tested, in Production, reviewed by key stakeholders (arch, product, etc.)
5. When should people be available and how? (e.g. work hours, availability via chat/phone etc.)
    1. As long as I don't have to be responsible for where you are at any given moment, I don't particularly care when you are available and how.
    1. e.g., if you are shipping something mission critical, I expect you to be present to troubleshoot or support.
    1. e.g., if you are working on something mission critical, give me a time to check in by so I don't bother you but am also not left in the dark.

## Personality quirks

1. What are the individual quirks that anyone working with me should know about?
    1. I do not follow most social culture things. I do not get modern references.
    1. I am the same person at work and at home. What you see is what you get.
    1. I value humility very highly. If you are arrogant or are unwilling to receive feedback, we will have a bad time.
    1. Political games tire me out. I am very much at work to accomplish whatever I am being paid to do.
    1. I consume most content at 2-10x speed.
