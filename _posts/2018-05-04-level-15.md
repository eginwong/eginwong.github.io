## The plan
Originally, I had planned to include code for the feature toggles in the previous post. Unfortunately, I ran out of time during the week.

In order to provide an example of the different types of feature toggles, I wanted to demonstrate setting-level configuration (determined on start-up of the application) as well as toggle-able results. 

Last time we checked in on our silly [Spring Boot application]({% post_url 2018-03-17-level-11 %}), we had gotten data to be returned to the user and were just about to write tests. As of this [commit](https://github.com/eginwong/fitness-tracker/commit/1960da337c4a35c22ee2b1750073b01223e9e1fe), the basic controller tests have been included. 

To demonstrate the feature toggle for the fitness tracker application, I decided to include weight as an attribute to each week's fitness progress. Every week, I take the average weight tracked on my phone and enter it as a log. The toggle-able feature will be to either return the data in metric (kg) or imperial (lb). 

For the **application configuration**, this weight conversion type can be set in the `application.properties` on startup. In another article, we can discuss changing these properties on the fly via [Spring Cloud Config](https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-config/).

For the **toggle-able** configuration, I want to be able to send a `POST` request to change the conversion type on the fly. The example is a bit contrived as the UI complement would usually recalculate values for display. However, without the UI, I still want to be able to demonstrate how to write such a feature toggle.

Now that we've clarified our approach, let's move on to the execution.

## The prepwork

First of all, we'll *actually* be doing TDD this around. We start with updating the database schema and data to include the new weight value.

```sql
CREATE TABLE FITNESS_LOG (
  ID        INT PRIMARY KEY,
  LOG_DATE  DATE,
  PUSHUPS   INT,
  PULLUPS   INT,
  CRUNCHES  INT,
  SUPERMANS INT,
  WEIGHT    DOUBLE
);
```

An astute observer will also note that there was a new column added to the `FITNESS_LOG` table. 

Beware, if the column is nullable, make sure to use the wrapper type of the primitive or else hibernate will scream.
{: .notice }

The data has also been updated:

```sql
INSERT INTO FITNESS_LOG (LOG_DATE, PUSHUPS, PULLUPS, CRUNCHES, SUPERMANS, WEIGHT) VALUES
  (18, '2017-04-29', 170, 86, 60, 0, 170.6),
  (17, '2017-04-22', 200, 110, 20, 20, 168),
  (16, '2017-04-15', 210, 111, 50, 0, null),
  ...
```

Note the `null` in the records for which we have no available data. Normally, we would test our persistence layer but as we're using JPA, there's no need.

## The tdd

When I first tried writing this code, I went straight into our existing `FitnessLogControllerTest` and started adding an endpoint used to set the conversion type. But before that, I couldn't figure out how to load up the spring boot application with values from the `application.properties`.

With a little digging, I found that creating a configuration class could work, and be a centralized approach to global configs in an application.

```java
package com.eginwong.physical.fitnesstracker.configuration;

import com.eginwong.physical.fitnesstracker.domain.ConversionType;
import org.junit.Assert;
import org.junit.Before;
import org.junit.Test;

import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;

public class ConversionConfigurationTest {

    private static final List<String> METRIC = Arrays.asList("METRIC", "METRIC", "KILOGRAMS", "KILOS", "KG");
    private static final List<String> IMPERIAL = Arrays.asList("IMPERIAL", "METRIC", "KILOGRAMS", "KILOS", "KG");

    private ConversionConfiguration conversionConfiguration;

    @Before
    public void setup() {
        conversionConfiguration = new ConversionConfiguration();
    }

    @Test
    public void set_type_metric() {
        conversionConfiguration.setType("METRIC");
        Assert.assertEquals(ConversionType.METRIC, conversionConfiguration.getType());
    }
}
```

I want to create a `ConversionConfiguration` class which will set a value for the conversion type, based on a `ConversionType` enum:

```java
package com.eginwong.physical.fitnesstracker.domain;

/**
 * The enum Conversion type which determines whether imperial or metric measurement is used.
 */
public enum ConversionType {
    IMPERIAL, METRIC
}
```

I stubbed out the basic Java class, so my code compiles but I get a fat failure.

![tdd-1]({{ "/assets/level-15-intellij-1.png" | absolute_url }}){:class="img-responsive"}{: .align-center}

In my actual `ConversionConfiguration` class, I add a static array of accepted values for metric and check if the list contains the input parameter. Note that there's no mention of imperial, as we're strictly writing enough code to get the test to pass.

```java
@Component
@ConfigurationProperties("conversion")
public class ConversionConfiguration {

    private static final List<String> METRIC = Arrays.asList("METRIC");
    private ConversionType type;

    public void setType(String conversionType) {
        if (METRIC.contains(conversionType)) this.type = ConversionType.METRIC;
    }
    ...
}
```

![tdd-2]({{ "/assets/level-15-intellij-2.png" | absolute_url }}){:class="img-responsive"}{: .align-center}

The current test suite seems a little limited, so I'll test for a few other keywords. I added in the imperial keywords as well, including lowercase and other edge cases. I want to make sure that the default value is set to imperial and that the conversion type should never be null. Test case time!

```java
    @Test
    public void default_conversion_type() {
        Assert.assertEquals(ConversionType.IMPERIAL, conversionConfiguration.getType());
    }
```

The corresponding code to make this test pass is quite simple:

```java
    public ConversionConfiguration() {
        this.type = ConversionType.IMPERIAL;
    }
```

Just update the value in the default constructor! (doy) Anyway, let's move on to the controller.

## Actually getting somewhere... ðŸ¤ 

In the `FitnessLogControllerTest`, I add a mockbean for the `ConversionConfiguration` class. This way, I should be able to access my global properties from within my controller. 

In order to mock the before and after state of my fitness log, I make use of two private variables in my test: `originalFitnessLog` and `expectedFitnessLog`. I include a helper method to set all the required attributes to be identical.

```java
    private FitnessLog originalFitnessLog;
    private FitnessLog expectedFitnessLog;

    @Before
    public void setup() {
        originalFitnessLog = new FitnessLog();
        expectedFitnessLog = new FitnessLog();
        modifyFitnessLog(originalFitnessLog);
        modifyFitnessLog(expectedFitnessLog);
    }
```

In my conversion test, I make sure to verify my actual result against my expected result.

```java
@Test
public void retrieve_all_fitness_logs_kgs() throws Exception {

    conversionConfiguration.setType("METRIC");
    expectedFitnessLog.setWeight(originalFitnessLog.getWeight() / KG_TO_LBS);

    Mockito.when(fitnessLogRepository.findAll()).thenReturn(Collections.singletonList(originalFitnessLog));
    mockMvc.perform(get("/api/fitness-logs?conversion=lbs"))
            .andExpect(MockMvcResultMatchers.content().contentType(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_UTF8_VALUE))
            .andExpect(MockMvcResultMatchers.status().isOk())
            .andExpect(jsonPath("$", hasSize(1)))
            .andExpect(jsonPath("$.[0].crunches").value(expectedFitnessLog.getCrunches()))
            .andExpect(jsonPath("$.[0].pullups").value(expectedFitnessLog.getPullups()))
            .andExpect(jsonPath("$.[0].pushups").value(expectedFitnessLog.getPushups()))
            .andExpect(jsonPath("$.[0].supermans").value(expectedFitnessLog.getSupermans()))
            .andExpect(jsonPath("$.[0].weight").value(expectedFitnessLog.getWeight()))
            .andExpect(jsonPath("$.[0].logDate").value(expectedFitnessLog.getLogDate().toString()));
}
```

Nice and failed, as expected.

![tdd-3]({{ "/assets/level-15-intellij-3.png" | absolute_url }}){:class="img-responsive"}{: .align-center}

Let's go ahead and implement the correct logic in the main `FitnessLogController` class. Haha... ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯ this didn't work out as expected.

## ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯

I couldn't wire the mock `ConversionConfiguration` class properly, especially alongside the `MockMVC` stuff. I took it as a sign that I was trying to do too much logic in the controller. After a brief sigh, I refactored out the controller logic into a separate service, and then re-did the tests. 

Alongside the testing, I wanted to more efficiently check for each of the attributes of my `FitnessLog` object. Therefore, I went into the POJO class and added built-in `equals()`/`hashcode()` methods. This way, I can do: 
```java
Assert.assertEquals(expected, actual);
```
which leads to fun, simple assertion stuff like this:

```java
@Test
public void retrieve_all_fitness_logs_lbs() {
    Mockito.when(fitnessLogRepository.findAll()).thenReturn(Collections.singletonList(originalFitnessLog));
    Assert.assertEquals(Collections.singletonList(expectedFitnessLog), fitnessLogService.retrieveFitnessLogs());
}
```

Anyway, all the tests pass and we're finished with the underlying business logic. Now, let's handle the feature toggling.

## Feature toggles, finally

### Setting configuration (on startup)

`ConversionConfiguration` is the right place to start. The aim is to toggle the conversion type based on what's set in my `application.properties` file. In order to start with my TDD, I have to look at how I can set these file-based properties in my tests.

Luckily, a coworker of mine was looking into [ReflectionUtils](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40301570/change-application-property-value-in-unit-test-method) for just the trick.

This is the test code that sets the private variables.
```java
@Test
public void property_file_configuration_setting() {
    ReflectionTestUtils.setField(conversionConfiguration, "type", ConversionType.METRIC);
    Assert.assertEquals(ConversionType.METRIC, conversionConfiguration.getType());
    ReflectionTestUtils.setField(conversionConfiguration, "type", ConversionType.IMPERIAL);
    Assert.assertEquals(ConversionType.IMPERIAL, conversionConfiguration.getType());
}
```

And my corresponding class code that reads from the properties file only uses the annotation `@ConfigurationProperties` and it's sufficient to set my private parameters as required.

With my `application.properties` set to METRIC:
```json
  ...
	{
		"id": 17,
		"logDate": "2017-04-22",
		"pushups": 200,
		"pullups": 110,
		"crunches": 20,
		"supermans": 20,
		"weight": 76.20360878518747
	},
	{
		"id": 18,
		"logDate": "2017-04-29",
		"pushups": 170,
		"pullups": 86,
		"crunches": 60,
		"supermans": 0,
		"weight": 77.38295034972013
	}
```

Without setting anything in my `application.properties`:

```json
...
	{
		"id": 17,
		"logDate": "2017-04-22",
		"pushups": 200,
		"pullups": 110,
		"crunches": 20,
		"supermans": 20,
		"weight": 168.0
	},
	{
		"id": 18,
		"logDate": "2017-04-29",
		"pushups": 170,
		"pullups": 86,
		"crunches": 60,
		"supermans": 0,
		"weight": 170.6
	}
```

The rounding could use some work, but I'm happy as it is. Let's get on to real-time toggling.

### On-the-fly toggling
In the new class `ConversionConfigurationService`, I want a way to be able to toggle the configuration via REST. I start with the tests and define the exact behaviour I would like to see from my service.

```java
@Test
    public void toggle_metric() {
        conversionConfigurationService.toggle("METRIC");
        Assert.assertEquals(ConversionType.METRIC, conversionConfiguration.getType());
    }

    @Test
    public void toggle_imperial() {
        conversionConfigurationService.toggle("IMPERIAL");
        Assert.assertEquals(ConversionType.IMPERIAL, conversionConfiguration.getType());
    }

    @Test
    public void toggle_plain() {
        // set starting point
        conversionConfigurationService.toggle("IMPERIAL");
        Assert.assertEquals(ConversionType.IMPERIAL, conversionConfiguration.getType());
        conversionConfigurationService.toggle();
        Assert.assertEquals(ConversionType.METRIC, conversionConfiguration.getType());
        conversionConfigurationService.toggle();
        Assert.assertEquals(ConversionType.IMPERIAL, conversionConfiguration.getType());
    }
```

From the tests, you can see that I can define exactly what state I want the conversion to be in, or I could just toggle between the both of them.

Here is the corresponding feature toggle code:

```java
    public void toggle(String setting) {
        conversionConfiguration.setType(setting);
    }

    public void toggle() {
        if (conversionConfiguration.getType().equals(ConversionType.IMPERIAL)) {
            conversionConfiguration.setType(ConversionType.METRIC);
        } else {
            conversionConfiguration.setType(ConversionType.IMPERIAL);
        }
    }
```

Not the most elegant solution, but it enables me to toggle this "feature", so I'm happy. After including the corresponding controller tests, we're off to the races.

I made the following `POST` call, using [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/):
`{{URL}}:8080/api/configuration/conversion?type=kgs` and things are working smoothly as expected. With tests, fancy that!

For all the code, check out my [github](https://github.com/eginwong/fitness-tracker/tree/part-ii).

Anyway, see y'all next time!
