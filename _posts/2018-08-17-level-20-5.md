## Breather!

When I first encountered problems related to bit manipulation, I was pretty intimidated. There were new symbols and operators that I didn't understand. For the most part, that is what learning is all about. It's about stretching our brains and thought patterns in ways we're not comfortable with until we're comfortable.
