Hoping to make this an annual thing - let's look at **2017**!

Pure stream-of-consciousness, sorry guys!

It was my first year of: 
* without real resolutions
* being employed and with no school 
* no debt over my head
* having to figure out what I wanted from life 
* really focusing on improving my technical chops
* getting a bonus
* going to a paid-for tech conference
* altar serving at a funeral
* playing speedpoint in ultimate
* playing in an ultimate league
* getting enough sleep, lel :sleeping:
* physiotherapy, and it literally changed my life
* working on a proficient team, learning real design
* understanding the difference between Google/Facebook/Microsoft/Amazon engineering and industry engineering :trollface:
* writing my first program in Java + Spring Boot
* travelling across Canada on the longest :train: journey ever
* being asked to be part of a bridal party
* being asked to be the best man :bowtie:
* asking a man to be my best
* sizeable charitable donations :moneybag:
* got an e-reader yay
* didn't rip my Christmas gifts on Christmas - actually forgot about them
* getting into road biking!
* got my first AmEx card

Some key events that stick out to me:
* my pursuit of learning Cantonese truly teetered off to the abyss
* transitioning from devops to front-end to full-stack engineering
* family getting a new :electric_plug: car
* wedding engagement :ring:
* combining my finances with my :woman:
* weightlifting PRs
* improving at ultimate and doing [bookends](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=bookends), the first definition!
* spiritual direction and really tackling my weaknesses and inner :japanese_ogre:
* decided against continuing with my P.Eng designation
* ongoing wedding planning
* all the hours with my niece
* finishing the Catechism of the Catholic Church
* stopped trying to churn money with PerkTV (it just got too hard)

As they say, it was pretty lit, fam.
