# Learning CSS Images

On a recent Saturday morning, I decided to rest a little by programming something fun. A year ago, a colleague of mine went through a live demo of creating an elephant entirely from CSS. 

I was inspired and have been meaning to get to learning it. 

## Follow the leader!

I had bookmarked a thorough guide on how to create a [koala](https://medium.com/coding-artist/a-beginners-guide-to-pure-css-images-ef9a5d069dd2). The writer breaks down very clearly the steps towards crafting our favourite digital animals.

In trying to abstract out the work and for future projects, I had some key takeaways.
- If you've ever seen powerpoint's layering feature, that's how CSS images tick
- HTML has semantic layering
  - and then added layering through CSS + [z-indices](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/z-index)
- For oblong shapes, use [clip-paths](https://bennettfeely.com/clippy/)
- Use variables in CSS for re-usability
```css
:root {
  --main-grey-color: #A6BECF;
  --off-grey-color: #819CAF;
}

.example {
  background: var(--off-grey-color);
}
```

With that [quick tutorial](https://codepen.io/eginwong/pen/qBOeXZb) finished, I decided to make something my own.

## The Sample

I solicited a fun design for my first project and got to work.

Here are a few things that I learned along the way.

1. Fancy backgrounds with gradients

2. Set color variables with color meter and [converting colors](https://convertingcolors.com/)

3. Remember the scale of your image and use them as relative guidelines. Without proper scale, the distinct features will look caricatured (unless that was your original intention).

For example:
```
total picture is 620px, 27.5%
hat is 170px, 450px from bottom
body is 450px, 72.5% 
nose is 115px, 18.5%, 275px from bottom
eyes is 85px, 370px from bottom
```

4. Have fun and don't take yourself too seriously!
