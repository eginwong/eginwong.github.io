Hoping to make this an annual thing - let's look at **2018**!

It was my first year of: 
* a new job and interviewing
* learning how to be a good husband
* learning a crap ton of stuff for software engineering
* 🐍 snake-ing in foosball
* going gym-less
* did my first tech talk / lunch and learn to a size-able audience
* launched work initiatives with results!
* played volleyball 🏐🏐🏐
* figuring out my ideal week
* started watching more ball!🏀🏀🔥🔥
* moved out
* became a Yelp Elite
* wine tasting in Niagara
* first toastmasters speech
* cooked lasagna!
* cliff-jumped and swam against a current
* body-surfing and observing the waves

Some key events that stick out to me:
* getting the `I do`
* spending time in Trinidad and Tobago and feeling that 🏝️🏝️ ⏱️⏱️
* counting down the New Year with a rosary!

It was a learning year and one full of changes. I guarantee next year will be even more eye-opening.
